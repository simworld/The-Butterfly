            <h2>Pre-Montessori Rooms</h2>
            <p>Meeting the developmental needs of children aged 2 to 2.5/3 years.</p>
            <p>The Pre-Montessori room serves as a stepping stone for children transitioning from the crèche to the Montessori program. We prioritize and encourage independence among the children, providing them with a supportive environment to develop self-sufficiency.
                In this room, we introduce the fundamentals of Montessori work, allowing children to enhance their concentration, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills.
                Potty training is a significant milestone during this stage, and our experienced team assists children in this important transition. </p>
